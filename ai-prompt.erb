The following is my solution to the [The Odin Project's Calculator
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). The project
files are listed below.

How can I make the output stretch to fill all the available space in the display except for what is taken by the operator?

<%=
    file_patterns = %w[
      calculator.js
      index.html
      README.md
      reset.css
      styles.css
    ]

    project_to_s(file_patterns:)
  %>
